	<!-- 
	 I'm Joe and I'm here to talk about Systems Thinking, which is a way of thinking that this year has entirely changed my view of how I view
	 the world of work. But first, some management history.

	<!-- 
	 Two different management styles have had influence on the way our work currently works. The first is from the milatary and is called Command
	 and Control.
	 
	 Shout, Punish, Punish Harder.
	 Used a lot by former military and authoritarian households.
	 3 Drawbacks: Smarty Pants Devs, Not Enough Managers (clean yer guns), More info at the worker level
	 Why Use it? Mines and Charge -> Life & Death. Need to shout orders even if suicidal, great for 18yo running through mine field

	<!-- 
	 Who is this?
	 Taylor created Scientific Management, separation of the thinkers and workers.
	 He used Descarte's style thinking to take something apart and put it back together again.
	 His emphases were on efficiency and productivity with time and motion studies. Fragmented work to specialize.
	 Took all responsibility from workers, paid by productivity.
	 Benefits: All for management, Very measurable, got managers on the shop floor, 
	 Drawbacks: Worker had no discretion, Very fragmented work (due to division of labour).
	 It has increased productivity and efficiency but at a a human cost. Boring repetitive jobs with no control. This led to unions.

	<!--	
	 These two techniques have had a profound impact on how the workplace has operated. This led to McGregor creating his Theory X and Y on 
	 motivation.
	 C&C and SM are sayin workers are: Lazy, Avoid responsibility, Therefore need control/coercion. Are Extrisically motivated by money.
	 McGregor proposed another extereme: Like working, Accept/seek responsibility, Need space to develop imagination/ingenuity and are 
	 instrinstically motivated.

	<!-- 
	 Around the same time an Austrain biologist called Bertalanffy came up with a counter argument to SM from a scienfific background called
	 the General Theory of Systems.
	 He contrasted Closed Systems in Science with Open systems which continuously interact with an external environment. 
	 Works well for things that are repeatable, crap for knowledge work.
	 This disproved the Descartes's scientific reductionism for studying systems. He proposed instead that we view systems in a Holtistic manner.

	Toyota, credited as being the foreigner having the most impact on Japan 
	
	Deming: System for profound change: for transformation from the present style of Western management to one of optimization."
"A manager of people needs to understand that all people are different. This is not ranking people. He needs to understand that the performance
 of anyone is governed largely by the system that he works in, the responsibility of management.

	  95% of the system, to 5% the worker.

	<!-- 
	  So Systems thinking is the process of understanding how things, regarded as systems, influence one another within a whole.
Example of room within house, within a street, within a town, within an environment.

In organizations, systems consist of people, structures, and processes that work together to make an organization "healthy" or "unhealthy"

Key parts are understanding your organisations purpose/goal, the flow of how customers put demand on your system and how you should effectively measure.

	  Obvious place to start is with a call centre, the place your customers usually first contact you.
	  
	-->
	
	<!--
	Ask yourself: What is the goal of my organisation, How does work flow in my organisation? Is this target related to our purose?
