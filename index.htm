	<!-- 
	 I'm Joe and I'm here to talk about Systems Thinking, which is a way of thinking that this year has entirely changed my view of how I view
	 the world of work. But first, some management history.

	 Two different management styles have had influence on the way our work currently works. The first is from the milatary and is called Command
	 and Control.
	 
	 Shout, Punish, Punish Harder.
	 Used a lot by former military and authoritarian households.
	 3 Drawbacks: Smarty Pants Devs, Not Enough Managers (clean yer guns), More info at the worker level
	 Why Use it? Mines and Charge -> Life & Death. Need to shout orders even if suicidal, great for 18yo running through mine field

	<!-- 
	 Who is this?
	 Taylor created Scientific Management, separation of the thinkers and workers.
	 He used Descarte's style thinking to take something apart and put it back together again.
	 His emphases were on efficiency and productivity with time and motion studies. Fragmented work to specialize.
	 Took all responsibility from workers, paid by productivity.
	 Benefits: All for management, Very measurable, got managers on the shop floor, 
	 Drawbacks: Worker had no discretion, Very fragmented work (due to division of labour).
	 It has increased productivity and efficiency but at a a human cost. Boring repetitive jobs with no control. This led to unions.

	 These two techniques have had a profound impact on how the workplace has operated. This led to McGregor creating his Theory X and Y on 
	 motivation.
	 C&C and SM are sayin workers are: Lazy, Avoid responsibility, Therefore need control/coercion. Are Extrisically motivated by money.
	 McGregor proposed another extereme: Like working, Accept/seek responsibility, Need space to develop imagination/ingenuity and are 
	 instrinstically motivated.

	<!-- 
	 Around the same time an Austrain biologist called Bertalanffy came up with a counter argument to SM from a scienfific background called
	 the General Theory of Systems.
	 He contrasted Closed Systems in Science with Open systems which continuously interact with an external environment. 
	 Works well for things that are repeatable, crap for knowledge work.
	 This disproved the Descartes's scientific reductionism for studying systems. He proposed instead that we view systems in a Holtistic manner.

    Toyota, credited as being the foreigner having the most impact on Japan.
    Lexus is built to order, rather than batched and sold.

    Built on McGregor to say work should be: Outside-In (top down), Designed against Demand,value.flow (specialisation), decision making should be integrated (seperated).
    Meausred by related to purpose, demo capability (activity, producitivity, standards). Intrinsic motivation (pride) rather than extrinsic (incentives).

    Stop sub-optimization. Creates waste for others.
	
	Deming: System for profound change: for transformation from the present style of Western management to one of optimization."
"A manager of people needs to understand that all people are different. This is not ranking people. He needs to understand that the performance
 of anyone is governed largely by the system that he works in, the responsibility of management.

	  95% of the system, to 5% the worker.

     Variation is called by systemL nature of task, availability of info, procedures. Some people would be terrified of the low numbers, but it's just to show variation in the process.

     There is variation in everything we do, by giving up trying to motivate and put policies in place, managers can become leaders by hearnessing the ingeinuity of their workers towards imprtiving the work, rather than against.

	  So Systems thinking is the process of understanding how things, regarded as systems, influence one another within a whole.
Example of room within house, within a street, within a town, within an environment.

In organizations, systems consist of people, structures, and processes that work together to make an organization "healthy" or "unhealthy"

CDD: Cusotomer-Driven Design.

Key parts are understanding your organisations purpose/goal, the flow of how customers put demand on your system and how you should effectively measure.

	Understand demand on system
	http://www.systemsthinking.co.uk/6-10.asp

    Purpose is to get and keep customers. Relationship is made up from transactions they have with it. Importnat to understand the nature of demand. Why they interact, and how the org responds.

    Call ('demand') from cuz pov. Understand what matters ('value'), and if the org
    deals with the work ('flow') in the most efficient way. Just do the value work, 
    service imporves, the cuz rel is built and costs fall.

    Most traditional managers struggle wit this, think better service is cost. Instead of costs, they should think causes of costs.

    Once you understand demand from cuz pov you see an alaraming amount of 'failure demand', caused by failing to do something right for the cuz. Major cost and damange
    to the rel. Some call centres it's 75%, at best 25%.

    When procedures don't match demand it results in waste, reowkr, duplication, lost time. By contrast you should design to flow against 'value'.

    Example: Call centre, 3m cutoff, goes in queue, causing duplication.

    A major cause of waste is batching, sorting, queuing and counting work.

    Bring specialists to the work floor, train. Average time didn't change.

	<!-- 
	 Targets: Measure activity rather than achieving their goal
	 Measures should relate to purpose

     Collect data over time. Look for the average.
     Set control limits for upper and lower boundaries.

     The first system measure you need is the purpose of the system from the cuz pov. Insurance System: settling claims. Usually hard to extract from IT systems.
     Scrap any activity measures, only total volume is useful from a traditional set. Total Volume allows you to judge the predictability and stability of the sytem.
